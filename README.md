# GraphQL API for Universal Chess Interface
This started as a [mock API I wrote](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/mocking-a-graphql-wrapper-around-the-universal-chess-interface-1c5bb1acd821) as a proof-of-concept for Chess.com. The implementation prooved difficult because the [UCI protocol](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html) is stream-based, and not designed for a call-response type API that GraphQL provides.  Nonetheless, this library represents a good progress. Ideas for further improvement can be found in the TODO.md file.

For this version, the implementation wraps an GraphQL API around an [embedded stockfish engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stockfish) (transpiled from original source to JavaScript). 

## Here are the package.json targets:
* npm run start
  * starts the GraphQL server
* npm run test
  * runs the unit tests
* other run targets are:
  * dev
    * hot server which reloads on code changes
  * mock
    * for API testing; the engine id is fixed at 1 rather than generated randomly
  * test-api
    * GraphQL API tests; server must be run in mock mode (see previous)

## The schema
I will assume some familiarity with GraphQL.  When the server is launched (`npm run start`, for example), you will see:
```
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:3001/graphql
ðŸš€ Subscriptions ready at ws://localhost:3001/graphql
```
Subscriptions are a GraphQL feature that allows a client to subscribe to events that are emitted form the stockfish engine wrapper. As of this writing, most of the GraphQL API is call-response, however when running analysis, _info_ strings (unparsed) are returned via subscription. Note that the url shown for subscriptions is for internal use only. See below.

## Launching an engine and doing analysis
The tests in test-api, when run, are a good illustration of API interaction, including subscribing to info events.  If you wish to use the GraphQL "playground", then point your browser to `http://localhost:3001/graphql`.  Here are some commands to start with (mind the order of execution!):

#### get version
```
query v {version}
```

#### create an engine instance
```
query e {
  createEngine {
    engineId
    state
  }
}
```
#### initiate the UCI protocol
```
mutation u {
  Engine(id: "1") {
  	uci {
      identity {
        name
        author 
      }
      uciok
    }
  }
}
```
#### set [spin|button|check|combo] option
These sound line UI settings, but are really engine options of various types. See the UCI documentation for the various arguments are.
```
mutation o {
  Engine(id: "1") {
  	setSpinOption(name:"Contempt" value: 100) 
  }
}
```

#### Check if the engine is ready for analyzing
```
mutation r {
    Engine(id: "1") {
  	isready {
      response
    } 
  }
}
```

#### go 
The `go` command returns the engine's evaluation of the best move for the current position
```
mutation g {
    Engine(id: "1") {
  	go {
			value
    } 
  }
}
```

#### go infinite
The engine will continue to evaluate the position until stopped.  As it does so, it will emit `info` responses; you must be subscribed to these to receive them. In the GraphQL "playground", a subscription must be started in a separate browser tab (same url):

```
subscription s {
  info
}
```

and, in the other tab:

```
mutation gi {
    Engine(id: "1") {
  	goInfinite 
  }
}
```

To stop the analysis:
```
mutation st {
    Engine(id: "1") {
  	stop {
			value
    } 
  }
}
```

The value returned (eventually, the engine does not stop immediately) will be the best move.

#### quiting the engine
```
mutation q {
  Engine(id: "1") {
    quit
  }
}
```
